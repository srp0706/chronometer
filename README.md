# chronometer
A simple start-stop-reset chronometer    
     
This started as an inside joke at work. Our SCRUM daily meetings were taking too long, so we came up with a rule that no one should speak for more than five minutes.
It was surprising to see people actually **asking** for the chronometer a couple weeks later when I forgot to open it in a daily. Go figure...   
    
   
Kudos to [Kinoton at Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/people/Kinoton/sounds/420650/) for the klaxon alert sound used. (I haven't included the file itself in this project, you should download it directly from the source)
    
## Usage instructions
1. Download the .html file.
2. Download the klaxon sound from the link provided and name it "klaxon.mp3" (or skip this step if you don't want/need the sound).
3. Place both files in the same directory.
4. Open the .html file in a browser.
